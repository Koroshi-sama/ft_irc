- the hostname (or prefix) doesn't get displayed when someone joins a channel
- test private msg from user to user


- The private message is working even if it seems that it's not, you can view
  the messages via /query <target> command
- There is a problem in the invite command, make sure it transmits the
  correct messages...

? when the command needs more params, make sure the error returned is handled
  by the irc client, because otherwise I'll have to return it?

- I have to add something so that when a channel is invite only, and when a
  user is invited, he can join, otherwise he can't ==> add a condition in
  the join command

- Check that the listing of operators (when an operator is added) is correct

- Check that invite is successful when a user is invited to an invite only 
  channel.              V

- Same thing with key.
